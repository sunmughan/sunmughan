<h2>Hi there 👋, I am Sunmughan</h2>

- 👨🏻‍💻  &nbsp;I’m primarily a Full Stack Developer. 
- 👨🏻‍🔬  &nbsp;I like experimenting with tech. This has led me into many interesting domains such as writing firmware code for Android Smartphones and building mobile SDKs for Android & iOS. 
- 🤗  &nbsp;I love contributing to the open-source ecosystem and the community by providing custom and interest based on demand services like Ecommerce, Enterprise Software Solutions, SaaS based Aps and Webapps, building Native libraries and frameworks for various trending platforms, etc. whenever I can.
- 🌱  &nbsp;I’m currently (trying to) learn Machine Learning
- 💬  &nbsp;I dabble in Android, Xcode, Flutter, React Native, Kotlin, Java, Rust, PHP, Xamarin, Ionic, UI/UX and spend most of my time automating my life via literally living inside the terminal 🤷🏻‍♂️
- 📝  &nbsp;I often blog about random tips/tricks and (mostly) Android in the past [at] [DROIDADDA](https://dxadda.blogspot.com/)
- ⚡️  &nbsp;Fun fact about me: I love playing 🕹&nbsp;retro games and survive on ☕️ instead of energy drinks 🙇🏻‍♂️ &nbsp;Possibly this is why I also talk a lot 🤔
